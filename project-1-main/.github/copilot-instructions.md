# Project Overview

This project is a web application that is meant to find produce items that are in season (based on the season and one's state of residence). It then makes recipe recommendations based on the resulting produce options.

## Tech Stack in use

- **Frontend**: HTML and CSS are used for layout and styling. JavaScript is used for coding behavior.

## General Guidelines

- All functions and classes must have clear, descriptive docstrings.
- Sanitize all user inputs thoroughly to prevent security vulnerabilities.
- Prioritize modular and reusable code components.

## Documentation Requirements

- Include JSDoc comments for all JavaScript/TypeScript files.
- Document complex functions with clear examples.
